questions: [

// How long have you attended Wellspring?
`I started attending Wellspring shortly after the merge, in spring of 2016.`,

//  What are your spiritual gifts and how have you served in churches in the past?
`I’ve had the opportunity to exercise the gifts of wisdom, shepherding,
leadership, and administration in co-leading a small group and serving on the
transformation team and nominating committee.`,

// How do you hope to serve in this season?
`My hope is that we as a church move together towards greater health in all
spheres - individually seeking depth of spiritual formation, rebuilding
bridges of connection in relationships, and listening to the hurting and
under-represented voices in our body and our community. I see these three -
formation, connection, and listening - as the core of my personal calling, and
ways in which I have been gifted for the sake of the building up of this body
in this difficult season.`,

//  What else would you like your Wellspring family to know about you?
`I’m Chinese-American, and grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs and Dubai. I
enjoy playing and listening to music, and relaxing with my two dogs.`
