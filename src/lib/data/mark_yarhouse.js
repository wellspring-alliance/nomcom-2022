questions: [

// How long have you attended Wellspring?
`My wife, Lori, and I started attending Wellspring in the fall of 2019.`,

//  What are your spiritual gifts and how have you served in churches in the past?
`Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to exercise the gifts of wisdom, shepherding,
leadership, and teaching in co-leading a home group, serving as an elder,
serving the Lord's Supper, participating in baptisms, and teaching Christian
education, as well as provide staff trainings at our previous church.`,

// How do you hope to serve in this season?
`In keeping with one of the recommendations from the transformation team, I would
love to see Wellspring grow together in part by looking back to our core values
of the word, prayer, community, and diversity, as well as discipleship and
global missions.  These have been and remain important building blocks for our
community.`,

//  What else would you like your Wellspring family to know about you?
`My wife, Lori, and I have been married 31 years and have adult three children.
Our children are from a different racial background than either of us. We have
come to deeply value being part of multiethnic communities in the past, and we
value the multiethnic community we have found at Wellspring.`
