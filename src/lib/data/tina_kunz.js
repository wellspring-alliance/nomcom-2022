Women INC groups, co-led a small group, and co-led a class on redeeming and
stewarding our ethnic identities (Beyond Colorblind).`,

encouragement to our leaders.`,

or bike, visiting coffee shops and exploring neighborhoods in Chicago with
friends and family, and hanging out with our toddler nieces.`
