questions: [

// How long have you attended Wellspring?
`We have been attending Wellspring since the fall of 2019.  We became members at
Wellspring in the winter of 2020.`,

//  What are your spiritual gifts and how have you served in churches in the past?
`I consider my gifts to be teaching, learning and serving.  I tend to be positive
by nature and I like to give encouragement and vision.  I naturally like to
include people and I tend to be adaptable, especially as it pertains to new
communities and cultures.
<br /><br />
Before moving to Wheaton, we lived in France for 17 years.  While we worked in
France with Cru, we were also involved with a small French church plant and for
the last 5 years I was a volunteer pastor along with another person.  Since we
are missionaries serving with Cru, we have always been involved to some degree
with missions in our local churches.  We have also been involved with leading
Home Groups and with community service efforts.

// How do you hope to serve in this season?
`I pray that our life together would be anchored in Jesus.  For me, this is not a
hallow phrase.  When we together honestly consider the life, the words and the
actions of Jesus, I believe that by the power of the Holy Spirit we will be
healed, renewed, reconciled and sent out.  Jesus always seemed to show grace and
compassion to those who were pushed to the side.  Jesus seemed to also reserve
his harshest words for the religious leaders.  As Jesus said to Nicodemus, "You
must be born again."  I'm praying that we would continually be born again as
Jesus opens our eyes and hearts to our neighbor and the needs of the world.`,

//  What else would you like your Wellspring family to know about you?
`I really enjoy sports, music and history.  While I grew up in the Midwest, I
loved living in France and speaking French.  I enjoy spending time with my
family.`
