questions: [

// How long have you attended Wellspring?
`I started attending Blanchard in 1984 and in 2001 took a 15 year hiatus to live
and work in northern Wisconsin. We returned to the area in 2016 and rejoined as
Wellspring.`,

//  What are your spiritual gifts and how have you served in churches in the past?
`I've been able to use my gift of helps and wisdom in several different roles
over the years: Sunday School teacher, drama team, governing board secretary,
and deacon. I currently serve as the interim deacon chair.`,

// How do you hope to serve in this season?
`I'd like to continue serving as deacon chair and expand awareness of deacons and
their roles, and also invite our church to use our gifts to help meet each
other's needs in tangible ways. We want to help people connect, receive, and
serve.`,

//  What else would you like your Wellspring family to know about you?
`My husband Don and I live in Lombard and just celebrated our 37th anniversary.
We have 2 adult children and 5 grandchildren (which makes me VERY happy.) We
share our home with my 91-year young mother. I enjoy listening to podcasts and
audiobooks on my frequent travels to spend time with our grandkids, and I want
to get to know more people in my Welllspring family.`
