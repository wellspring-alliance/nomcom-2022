questions: [

// How long have you attended Wellspring?
`10 years. My wife, Dana, and I committed to Blanchard/Wellspring shortly after
moving to Wheaton from Kansas in 2012.`,

//  What are your spiritual gifts and how have you served in churches in the past?
`I haven't taken a spiritual gifts inventory in a long time so I don't have an
objective measure to back this up, but I consider my strengths to include
leadership/administration, mercy, giving, and serving.
<br /><br />
I have served in many different roles in my four+ decades as a Christian,
including Bible study leader, home group leader, campus (college) ministry,
worship leader, deacon, and elder. During our decade at Blanchard/Wellspring,
Dana and I have focused our energies on college students, hosting a group in our
home on Sunday nights during the academic year for a meal, worship, devotional,
and prayer.`,

// How do you hope to serve in this season?
`I simply want to care for and serve people in need since I believe that is one
of the core responsibilities of disciples of Jesus (and therefore not limited to
an elected deacon role).`,

//  What else would you like your Wellspring family to know about you?
`I have an MA in Biblical Studies from Wheaton College, graduating in 2016. I
recently retired from Wheaton College after 40 years of work in information
technology in higher education (first 30 years at Kansas State University). Dana
and I will celebrate our 43rd anniversary this summer and have three
adult/married children and five grandchildren.`
