questions: [

// How long have you attended Wellspring?
`I have attended Wellspring since 2018.`,

//  What are your spiritual gifts and how have you served in churches in the past?
`Prayer and discipleship. Although prayer may feel like slow and ineffective, I
have experienced that prayer is the surest and fastest way to have God’s will be
done in my life and church through discernment of His heart and surrender to it.
I also believe I’m called to help individuals deeply rooted in Christ and grow
as reproducing disciples.
<br /><br />
As for visible services in church, I’ve served as a deacon (2019-2021) and home
group leader for Korean speaking congregants (2019-present). God gave me a
motherly heart for Wellspring. This church is so precious for numerous reasons,
so prayer for Wellspring is my invisible work, joy, and rewards.
`,

// How do you hope to serve in this season?
`Wellspring is very special and precious -- a church that doesn’t shy away from
wrestling with difficult topics or confine God within our comfort zone. As a
church that strives to follow the immensity of God in the broad gamut of pure
gospel, work of Spirit, international work, social justice, etc., I believe God
has very special mission and vision for Wellspring. Our church is blessed and
privileged with so many resources and gifts, which makes us responsible for
local/international and believing/nonbelieving communities beyond Wheaton.
<br /><br />
Additionally, it appears “social justice” has replaced the position of “God” as
the ultimate goodness while U.S. society enters the era of post-Christianity.
Therefore, Wellspring as a truly multicultural/multiethnic church (i.e., a
microcosm of heaven) would give important messages to both church communities
and nonbelieving society.
<br /><br />
I see hope in Wednesday prayer meetings when individuals with different
thoughts, positions, etc. gather and pray together in one Spirit. I experience
the healing power of oneness when we pray together, which we need to fulfill the
God given mission and vision for Wellspring. Additionally, I hope my background
as a counseling/cultural psychologist would help church recover from the wounds,
navigate cultural/racial dynamics as a multicultural/multiethnic church, and
have God’s vision realized within and through our church.
`,

//  What else would you like your Wellspring family to know about you?
`I’m blessed with a husband, two adult children, their spouses, and four
grandkids. I grew up as a child of a Baptist pastor and accepted Jesus as my
savior and lord at the age of 18. My family immigrated from S. Korea to the U.S.
24 yeas ago. I currently work as a professor in Counseling Psychology program at
Loyola University Chicago.`
