questions: [

// How long have you attended Wellspring?
`I have attended Wellspring/Blanchard since 1988.`,

//  What are your spiritual gifts and how have you served in churches in the past?
`I have served musically and also through transporting people to appointments
when they are unable to drive, making and delivering food, praying with those
who are ill, making hospital visits, working on several Wellspring clean-up
crews for outdoor projects in Wheaton and also following a downstate hurricane.
Also served as a Stephen minister for about four years and went on the Dubai
missions trip.`,

// How do you hope to serve in this season?
`In the upcoming season at Wellspring, I hope to continue in much the same way
as I have in the past, fitting in where physical or spiritual help is needed.`,

//  What else would you like your Wellspring family to know about you?
`Iâ€™m from a NYC suburb. My plan was to attend a music school in New York, but I
came to Wheaton College instead. It was the right decision. Both the college and
Blanchard helped my very new and feeble faith to grow. I am a news reporter and
a music teacher.`
