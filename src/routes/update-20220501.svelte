  Update: May 1, 2022

<p>
  A few weeks ago the Nominating Committee asked for your
  input on potential leaders within our body. <strong>35 of you</strong>
  shared <strong>115 recommendations</strong> of <strong>78 different
  people</strong>. This is far more input than we’ve received in recent
  years. So, those of you who took a few minutes to share your input…
  <em>thank you!</em> We are really grateful and encouraged by this.
  It demonstrates that you as a body are engaged, that you care deeply
  about Wellspring’s future. It also highlights what a gifted congregation
  we have.
</p>

<p>
  And… this presents a challenge for the nominating committee. We started
  this process later than usual (due to timing of the CHC report) and
  received far more input than usual. Our committee has finite resources and
  time – practically, there’s no way we could reach out to everyone who was
  raised to our attention. So, we’ve had to prioritize our outreach based on
  a variety of factors, including: the number of recommendations someone
  received, the content of the recommendations, past conversations with the
  Committee and other factors.
</p>

<p>
  We want to remind you that a <em>recommendation</em> to the committee is
  not the same as a <em>nomination</em> for an elected position. A
  recommendation puts someone on our radar. A nomination requires a lot of
  additional conversations, prayer and discernment, as well as willingness
  to serve on the part of the nominee. If you were recommended to the
  committee and you haven’t heard from us, don’t be discouraged! 1
  Corinthians 12 reminds us that we all need each other. We all have
  spiritual gifts. We’re all called to serve. Only a few of you will be
  called upon to serve in an elected leader position at this time. If that’s
  not you, your gifts and service are no less important to this body. We
  encourage you to be prayerful and faithful about how you are called to
  serve in this season.
</p>

<p>
  Over the next couple weeks, the committee will be very engaged in
  conversations, prayer and discernment around potential nominees. And
  candidates will also be in prayer and discernment. Towards the end of May,
  we will finalize our nominations and communicate them to the congregation.
  We’ll then provide some opportunities to get to know the candidates before
  our June election. Please pray for the Nominating Committee during these
  crucial next few weeks!
