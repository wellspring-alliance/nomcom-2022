<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3>
  How did the unique season we are in as a church impact the Nominating Committee’s work?
</h3>
<p>
  We began our work with a strong sense that we would need to approach our work differently this
  year. One of our first tasks as a team was to discuss our shared <em>vision, intentions and
  means</em> in relation to our nomination work. The output of that discussion was a statement of
  <a href="/vision">vision, context and commitments</a> that has guided us in our work.
</p>

<h3>
  How did the committee identify potential candidates for various roles?
</h3>
<p>
  In past years, the Nominating Committee has asked the congregation to share recommendations and
  input on potential candidates for elected leadership positions. Unfortunately, the amount of input
  the committee has received in recent years had been limited. We hoped that if we made a stronger
  “call” and push for recommendations the congregation would respond. <em>You did!</em>
</p>

<p>
  A few weeks ago the Nominating Committee asked for your input on potential leaders within our
  body. <em>35 of you</em> shared <em>115 recommendations</em> of <em>78 different people</em>.
  This is far more input than we’ve received in recent years. So, those of you who took a few
  minutes to share your input… <em>thank you!</em> We are really grateful and encouraged by this.
  It demonstrates that you as a body are engaged, that you care deeply about Wellspring’s future. It
  also highlights what a gifted congregation we have. In addition, members of this committee pooled
  their collective knowledge of our congregation to suggest prospective candidates.
