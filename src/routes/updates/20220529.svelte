<h2>
  Update: May 29, 2022
</h2>

<p>
  You’ve heard from us a couple times this year as we’ve been intentional this
  year about transparency and communication. We wanted to share an update on where
  we are in our process and what to expect next.
</p>

<h3>Where we are</h3>

<p>
  Let’s start with where we are in our process. I’m honored and grateful to report
  that the committee has finalized our nominations for all of the Governing Board
  and Deacon positions that needed to be filled! I can tell you in all honesty
  that this was not an easy process this year. The committee wrestled through many
  tough (and long) conversations, honestly expressing a wide range of opinions and
  perspectives, while maintaining a culture of respect, charity and trust. The
  nominations represent hard fought unity in our decisions as a committee. Thank
  you Felicia, Grace, James, Philip, and Young Ok!
</p>

<p>
  We were hoping to communicate the nominees to you this morning, and to follow
  that up with an email communication this week. We decided not to do that, and I
  ask you to be patient with us for just a couple more days. We are extremely
  mindful of the importance of sharing this information with the body as soon as
  possible. We are also very mindful that we take appropriate care for the
  content, spirit and impact of our communication. So please grant us a little
  more grace and patience, and we will communicate with you all via email this
  week.
</p>

<h3>Upcoming communication</h3>

<p>
  This will most likely come as a link in the eNews to a page with more
  information, or possibly as a separate email. I want to invite you all to be
  intentional to read that communication. It will include who we’re nominating
  along with nominee bios, as well as a Nom Com FAQ that addresses questions we’ve
  received or ones we anticipate, covering how we went about our process and some
  background and rationale for certain decisions. If you have specific questions
  you’d like to see addressed in that FAQ, please send them to
  nomcom@wellspringalliance.net. Reading through this information sooner rather
  than later will help you come prepared to vote at our annual meeting elections.
</p>

<h3>Annual Meeting</h3>

<p>
  Speaking of our annual meeting – as you hopefully read in Friday’s Governing
  Board communication, the meeting is June 12th at 6pm. This meeting is very
  important to the life and to the governance of our church! You’ll hear updates
  from various Governing Board and ministry leaders, and this is where we’ll
  actually vote on elected leadership positions. If you’re a member, please plan
  to attend in person if at all possible. If you’re unable to join in person, we
  will have a livestream option as well. If you’re a regular attendee but not yet
  a member, you’re absolutely welcome to attend as well… just know that you won’t
  be eligible to vote in the elections.
</p>

<h3>Voting / Floor Nominations</h3>

<p>
  We want to make voting available for those members that are in-person as well as
  members on the livestream, so we’ll be using an electronic voting system like we
  have the past two years. Because of this, it will greatly help us to know in
  advance of any “floor nominations”. If there is an individual who is not being
  nominated by the Nominating Committee who you wish to put forward as a nominee,
  and you have spoken to that individual and confirmed that they willing to have
  their name put forward, please email their name and the role you’re nominating
  them for to nomcom@wellspringalliance.net. We ask you to do this by June 10th
  (two days before the annual meeting)
</p>

<h3>Nom Com nominees</h3>

<p>
  Finally, there’s one role the Nominating Committee doesn’t formally nominate
  candidates for, and that’s our next Nominating Committee! We will elect 3
  members to this committee at the annual meeting, and our new Governing Board
  will later appoint 3 additional members. If you know someone who is spiritually
  mature, who enjoys talking to people, and who cares deeply about the leadership
  needs of our church, please consider nominating them. As with other nominations,
  we ask that you first confirm they are willing to serve in this role, and then
  email their name and the role of Nom Com to nomcom@wellspringalliance.net, and
  again, to do so by June 10th.
</p>


<p>
  Thank you,<br/><br/>
  Wellspring Nominating Committee<br/>
  Felicia Bullock, Grace Chan, James Cuénod, Philip Han, Young Ok Kim, Ken Kunz (chair)<br />
  Pastor Mitch Kim (ex officio)
