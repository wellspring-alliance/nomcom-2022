<h1>Vision</h1>

<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>
  The Wellspring Nominating Committee exists for a <strong>limited season</strong>
  to identify the most <strong>qualified candidates</strong> to fill Wellspring’s
  elected leadership positions and to <strong>clearly communicate</strong> that slate
  of nominees to our church body.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Limited Season:</strong> Unlike standing committees, the Nominating
    Committee is a “popup committee” – new committee is elected / appointed annually,
    begins work in January, finishes shortly after the annual member meeting in June.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Qualified Candidates:</strong> both individually and collectively…
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>individually</em> – character (spiritual maturity), competencies (spiritual
        gifts, strengths, experience), and commitment (to a path forward for Wellspring;
        to the responsibilities of the role)
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>collectively</em> – diversity (across many dimensions); ability to navigate
        conflict
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Clearly Communicate:</strong> what are the roles, who are the nominees, why
    we believe they are the right people for the roles at this time.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Context</h2>
<p>
  Wellspring is in a season of crisis. The climate within our church body is one of
  uncertainty about the future and decreased confidence in leadership. Meanwhile, our
  leaders feel exhausted by the increased demands on their time and emotional energy
  and the increased scrutiny of their decisions and motives.
</p>
<p>
  This makes our work as a committee both <em>harder</em> and <em>more important</em>.
  <em>Harder</em> to find qualified leaders who are willing to sign up for leadership
  or continue to serve in this context. <em>More important</em> because the stakes are
  higher – we must begin to rebuild trust in order to move forward as a community.
</p>
<p>
  This context must inform our work – including how we work together as a team, how
  we involve the congregation, who we seek to nominate, and how we communicate with
  the body throughout the process. And above all… how we depend on God and seek Him
  throughout this process – the God of all grace and truth who redeems all things.
</p>

<h2>Our Commitments</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    We will strive to create a <strong>culture of respect, charity and trust</strong>
    with one another and others.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will seek <strong>genuine unity rather than simple majority rule</strong> in
    our shared decisions.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will value <strong>thoroughness over efficiency</strong> in our discernment process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Will will strive to <strong>balance transparency and confidentiality</strong> with one
    another and with the body.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will <strong>represent and uphold C&MA Beliefs</strong> in our process and in the
    nominees we identify.
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    Have the courage to share honestly; don’t leave anything unsaid in the process.

    When we mess up or hurt one another, we will confess, pursue reconciliation and forgiveness.
  </li>

    We will be <em>transparent whenever possible</em> regarding our process, decisions

  <li>
    We will <em>hold things in confidence</em> when necessitated by the sensitive nature
    of a topic or to respect the wishes of those involved.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will strive to be clear about whether confidentiality is required in a given
    situation; when in doubt, we will assume confidentiality until we confirm otherwise.

    leadership structures.

  <li>
    We expect the same from nominees for elected positions.
